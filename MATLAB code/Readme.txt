To load image into Block Memory Generator (BMG), we need to convert out image into .coe file 
For that i used MATLAB to convert jpg into coe and also since my basys3 board has less BRAM capacity, I did flatten and grayscale the image which fits my memory capacity 
Change the code accordingly for your desired resolution and colour
